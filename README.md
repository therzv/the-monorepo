# Turborepo starter
This is an official Yarn v1 starter turborepo.

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:


### Description of the problem and solution
- This is monorepo and i still dont have any deep experience handling monorepo 

- I create two Jenkinsfile for web service and docs service
- I create two helm chart for web service and docs service
- This Jenkinsfile stage are follows
  * triggered by changes on specific branch for spesific service
  * clone the code repository
  * build the docker image
  * push image to registry
  * deploy the changes to kubernetes cluster by installing helm chart


### The reasoning behind your technical choices, including architecture.
- From my expericence, handling containerized application is better with container orchestaration tools
  in this case, i choose Kubernetes

### Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do
- The Dockerfile i made is not tested yet, and i believe we still improve that Dockerfile
  (i put Dockerfile inside `web` and `docs` directory)
- The Jenkins pipeline still handle CI/CD. Best practice for this is separating CI and CD process.
  Might be Jenkins for CI and Argo for CD.


### differently if you were to spend additional time on the project.



### Apps and Packages

- `docs`: a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) app
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Utilities

This turborepo has some additional tools already setup for you:

- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for static type checking
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for code linting
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io) for code formatting

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
yarn run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
yarn run dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turborepo.org/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```

This will authenticate the Turborepo CLI with your [Vercel account](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/personal-accounts/overview).

Next, you can link your Turborepo to your Remote Cache by running the following command from the root of your turborepo:

```
npx turbo link
```
